A really simple view of the web minus the code and the wires and all the 
intermediate hardware. See a more complex view of the web at 
http://www.opte.org/[Opte]. Once you have seen the interconnectedness of 
the web on Opte and reviewed the technical details of how that diagram was 
created your first observation should be that every server and every client 
has access to all other servers and clients in the world. Yes! Your good 
customers can find your website on your server and the bad guys can find it 
too! Code you write, websites and computers under your control must take 
into account and protect against https://www.us-cert.gov/[known]

Client Side
~~~~~~~~~~~
In web parlance a _Client_ such as legacy browsers Internet Explorer, 
Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Safari exist on ones personal computing hardware 
as a means to access information on a remote server. The client technology 
is rapidly evolving as apps for hardware such as smart phones and wearable 
devices. Rapid evolution and competition has led to some variance in the 
way each browser interprets the code it receives in a web page. Features 
that work in one browser may not work at all in others, which has led to 
the need for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-browser[cross-browser] 
testing and the development of
